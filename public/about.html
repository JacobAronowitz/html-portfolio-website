I am currently an Honors College student in the U.A. Whitaker School of Engineering at Florida Gulf Coast University, <br>

I have made the U.A. Whitaker School of Engineering's Dean's List for the semesters of Fall 2022 and Fall 2023, the FGCU President's List <br>
for the semester of Fall 2024, and received the FGCU President's Gold Scholarship alongside my full 4 year Florida Bright Futures Scholarship.

I have been programming since the 4th grade, starting with courses on Khan Academy, and taking business IT and programming-related <br>
classes all throughout my middle and high school career. My skills include fluency in the Java, Python, and C++ programming languages <br>
as well as some experience in Windows Powershell Scripting. I also have experience in network and system administration using <br>
Red Hat Linux, penetration testing experience using Kali Linux, and automated testing experience using Selenium. I am also well-versed <br>
in PostgreSQL database work and documentation skills including the creation of SRS documents and standard minutes taking.

I have been involved with the Boy Scouts of America since Kindergarten, having earned the rank of Eagle Scout and earned my Bronze, Gold, <br>
and Silver Eagle Palms as well. I was also a part of the Order of the Arrow, which is Scouting's service-based Honor Society, achieving <br>
the rank of Brotherhood while also serving on the ceremonies team for Aal-Pa-Tah Lodge 237.

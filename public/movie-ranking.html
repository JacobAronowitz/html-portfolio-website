 <h2>The best movies of all time according to me, Jacob Aronowitz, professional movie watcher guy</h2>
 
 <hr>

<h3>1. Beetlejuice</h3>
<p>All I have to say is that if you hate Beetlejuice, then I hate you. A lot.</p>

<h3>2. Killer Klownz from Outer Space</h3>
<p>Same reason as number 1: if you hate it, I hate you. <br>
    Peak movie with peak practical effects. Solid A tier movie.</p>

<h3>3. Swiss Army Man</h3>
<p>Actually a very sweet movie and I wish I was able to see it for the first time again;<br>
     no other movie will touch me like that one did on my first watch.
     Actually, <br>some probably have but I just can't remember right now lol.</p>
